# Movie Trailer
This is my Capstone project performed for the Machine Learning nanodegree at Udacity.  The purpose of this work is to find a regression line to represent the body's production of glucose throughout the day.  This will give a diabetic the ability to find an close fit basal insulin rate to counteract normal body glucose production.

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and we will be using preinstalled packages that come with the Anaconda 2 installation package:

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer. 

### Code

My code for broken into two files:

- `media.py`
- `entertainment_center.py`

The supplement file is `fresh_tomatoes.py` which will produce the Movie Trailer website.

### Run

Navigate to the project folder and double click (or single click) `entertainment_center.py` to execute file.  The movie trailer site will open in the web browser.  Enjoy.

## Website

Page does present required content (movie title, box art and trailer link). 

**Movies**

1. Toy Story
