# Movie Trailer
In this project you will build a Movie Trailer Website where users can see my favorite movies and watch the trailers. I wrote server side code to store a list of movie titles, box art, poster images, and movie trailer URLs. The data will then be expressed on the web page and allow users to review the movies and watch the trailers.

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and we will be using preinstalled packages that come with the Anaconda 2 installation package:

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer. 

### Code

My code for broken into two files:

- `media.py`
- `entertainment_center.py`

The supplement file is `fresh_tomatoes.py` which will produce the Movie Trailer website.

### Run

Navigate to the project folder and double click (or single click) `entertainment_center.py` to execute file.  The movie trailer site will open in the web browser.  Enjoy.
